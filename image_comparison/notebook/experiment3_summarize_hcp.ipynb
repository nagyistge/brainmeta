      "# Image Comparison for Whole Brain Statistical Maps\n",
      "\n",
      "### The Basic Story\n",
      "1. We do brain imaging to understand cognitive processes, and how the brain influences health and behavior. \n",
      "2. If we understand the link between brain, behavior, health, and well-being, we can help people.\n",
      "3. We need meta-analysis to synthesize all this brain imaging. With meta-analysis we can find consensus across studies, validate new results, and discover interesting patterns revealed with large data.\n",
      "5. Coordinate based meta analysis was the old way of doing it, but now we have whole brain maps. We've demonstrated using whole brain maps is better.\n",
      "6. Thus we need to be able to do optimized meta-analysis with whole brain maps.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Goals of the Researcher conducting Meta-Analysis\n",
      "Generally, the goal is to find similar maps from \"data in the wild\" that would go into some whole brain meta-analysis. I also want to be confident that my choice of similarity metric, including / not including thresholded images, and image transformation is in line with my goals as a researcher.  For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "- *Case 1*: I have a \"query\" image (let's say a component from an ICA) and I know nothing else about it.  If I search against a database of whole brain maps, I want to find maps that are spatially, and/or value-wise, similar.  Those \"other\" images may have contrast (or some other meta-data) labels, and I could look for enrichment of these terms in the most similar maps from my result. It could be the case that I want to first search for whole brain maps with similar activation in my smaller region (eg, \"intersection\" strategy) for a whole brain meta-analysis, and then find a different set of \"mini maps\" to use like coordinate data for a coordinate based meta-analysis. \n",
      "- *Case 2*: I have a whole brain statistical map result for which I know the contrast and task, and I want to find maps that are assessing the same cognitive process to look for consensus.  The other images (mostly) don't have labels, and I want to find the right number / set to include.\n",
      "- *Case 3*: I'm in the Poldracklab and very frustrated that no one wants to add contrast labels to their uploaded maps. If I have a small subset of maps with labels, I could generate probabilities that each map comes from a particular task or contrast. If I am able to generate a reasonably sized set with high confidence of a task or process, I could then do a meta-analysis. I should have some degree of confidence about the kind of maps that are returned (not having labels) with regard to task or contrast similarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Questions that we don't know the answer to\n",
      "- If the maps I'm comparing my result to are tiny or thresholded, does that bias what is returned?\n",
      "- For Case 2: how many images can I use from my result and still have confidence they are an equivalent task or contrast? What similarity score should I \"cut\" at?\n",
      "- Is pearson or spearman more robust to tiny or thresholded maps? Why?\n",
      "- If I do a search and I am confident in my TASK, CONTRAST, can I be confident that some percentage of my top results are from an equivalent task? contrast? group?\n",
      "- What has a bigger influence on similarity scores: having the same group, task, or contrast?\n",
      "\n",
      "### What I Am Doing\n",
      "The above hints at the \"gold standard\" of what is desired for an image comparison to derive a set of images for meta-analysis.  We are concerned with the output of the comparison, namely, the labels of the maps [contrast, task, and group].  This forms our \"gold standard\" to assess how different strategies for handling missing data muck around with that ordering.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### Why Anyone Should Care\n",
      "If the way that we handle the missing values changes the set that is returned, this will influence what we learn from the meta-analysis, and the conclusions that we make about the brain-behavior link."

      "### Summary of HCP Task Data\n",
      "- The HCP datasets have 7 tasks, with 86 contrasts (see table below)\n",
      "- There are a total of 501 subjects that have done these tasks\n",
      "- Of the 501, 465 subjects have completed all tasks, all contrasts\n",
      "\n",
      "### What I Need Feedback On\n",
      "Let's decide on the size of the groups, if membership is consistent across tasks/contrasts (see details below) and then I will move forward getting these group maps created and analyses underway!\n",
      "\n",
      "### Proposal\n",
      "and questions for discussion!\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Size of the groups \n",
      "I want to go for an \"average\" number of subjects included in a typical experiment, but since we have lots of data, there is no reason to not go a little larger.  I could generate:\n",
      "- 15 groups per task (N=31 per group) for each of the 86 task-contrasts for a total of 1290 groups \n",
      "- 5 groups per task (N=93 subjects per group) for a total of 430 groups [I think this is the one I like]\n",
      "- 10 groups per task (N=46 per group) for a total of 860 groups\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Groups between tasks\n",
      "I think it would make sense to randomly sample (without replacement of course) to determine the groups, but to keep the groups consistent between different tasks/contrasts, to elicit having different studies done on the same people. (Eg, group 1 for task1-contrast1 is the same as group1 for task1-contrast2, and task2-contrastX)\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Levels of Assessing Rankings\n",
      "A \"ranking\" instead of a list of pearson/spearman scores would look something like this:"

      "You can imagine that each of these might be a kind of search that a researcher would do in NeuroVault.  The first question is finding the absolute most similar group maps.  The second question would suggest that the contrasts aren't very unique.  The third question would hint that there is some bias with regard to the study itself (eg, scanner, error in analyses).\n",
      "\n",
      "*Important Note* We would still be able to do all the analyses looking at the scores themselves.  However the ranking would be based on this labels, which is a much more \"real world\" use-case (I think) than having this arbitrary base standard based on the scores alone!\n",

      "I would do both spearman and pearson.  Speaman because it is principled and right, pearson because that's what everyone does, and I want to be able to make a comparison between the two, and make some early suggestions about metrics (even if this will come in the next paper about more similarity metrics!)"
