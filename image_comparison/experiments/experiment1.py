#/usr/bin/python Experiment 1:
# Individual images compared to transformations of themselves.

#1. Define "gold standard" as a comparison of image A with itself (using brain mask I assume?).
#2. Define a range of thresholds to apply to image (from unthresholded --> coordinate)
#3. Define a set of similarity metrics to use
#4. For each of pairwise comparison, pairwise inclusion, and brain mask, and for each similarity metric, test how scores change at the different levels of threshold.
